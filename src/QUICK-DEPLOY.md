## ⚠️ If Something Breaks

### Build Fails on Netlify?

Check the deploy log in Netlify dashboard. Common issues:

**Unused Import Warning:**
```bash
# Look for something like:
# 'X' is defined but never used

# Fix: Remove that import from the file
```

**Syntax Error:**
```bash
# Error: Unexpected token
# Usually means a missing closing tag or bracket

# Check your JSX carefully
```

### Scoring Looks Wrong?

Add debug logging in the `calculateScore()` function:

```javascript
const calculateScore = () => {
  const domainScores = [
    (answers.customerClarity1 + answers.customerClarity2) / 2,
    (answers.messagingStrength1 + answers.messagingStrength2) / 2,
    (answers.brandPositioning1 + answers.brandPositioning2) / 2,
    (answers.corporateStory1 + answers.corporateStory2) / 2,
    (answers.marketPresence1 + answers.marketPresence2) / 2
  ];
  
  console.log('Domain Scores:', domainScores);
  
  const total = domainScores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);
  
  console.log('Total:', total);
  console.log('Final Score:', Math.round(total * 10));
  
  return Math.round(total * 10);
};
```

### Questions Won't Advance?

Check that the answer is being saved. Add to the button's onClick:

```javascript
onClick={() => {
  console.log('Setting answer:', currentQuestion.id, '=', option.value);
  setAnswers(prev => ({ ...prev, [currentQuestion.id]: option.value }))
}}
```
